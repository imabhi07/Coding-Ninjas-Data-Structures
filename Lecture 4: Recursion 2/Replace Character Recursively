Given an input string S and two characters c1 and c2, you need to replace every occurrence of character c1 with character c2 in the given string.


void replaceCharacter(char a[], char c1, char c2) {
    if(a[0]=='\0'){
        return ;
    }else if(a[0]==c1){
        a[0]=c2;
    } replaceCharacter(a+1,c1,c2);
}
