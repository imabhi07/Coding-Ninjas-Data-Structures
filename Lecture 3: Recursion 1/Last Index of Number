Given an array of length N and an integer x, you need to find and return the last index of integer x present in the array. Return -1 if it is not present in the array.
Last index means - if x is present multiple times in the array, return the index at which x comes last in the array.


int lastIndex(int a[], int n, int x) {
    if(n==0){
        return -1;
    }
    if(a[n-1]==x){
    	return n-1;
	}
    else{
    	lastIndex(a,n-1,x);
    }
}
