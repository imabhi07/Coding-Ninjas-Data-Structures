Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move all disks from source rod to destination rod using third rod (say auxiliary). The rules are :



void towerOfHanoi(int n, char s, char h, char d) {
    if(n==0){
        return ;
    }
    towerOfHanoi(n-1,s,d,h);
    cout<<s<<" "<<d<<endl;
    towerOfHanoi(n-1,h,s,d);
}
